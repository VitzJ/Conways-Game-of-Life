Conways-Game-of-Life

Description: Conway's Game of Life Using simple lists and dictionaries to record
cell propagation data.

Comments inside of file clearly describe the important parts of the code.
The code is written in the format of a class because this was what was required
at the time it was written for the assignment submission.


The standard format for creating a base is as follows:

(x = width of base , y = height of base)

create_base(x, y)


To iterate through a base:

(z = number of iterations of your choice)

create_base(x, y).iteration(z)


Cells are denoted by "X"

of the work at the time.
