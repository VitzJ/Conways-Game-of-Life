# Conways-Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life Using simple lists and dictionaries.

Comments inside of file clearly describe the important parts of the code.
The code is written in the format of a class because this was what was required
at the time it was written for the assignment submission.


The standard format for creating a base is as follows:

(x = width of base , y = height of base)
create_base(x, y)

To iterate through a base:

(z = number of iterations of your choice)
create_base(x, y).iteration(z)

Cells are denoted by "X"
